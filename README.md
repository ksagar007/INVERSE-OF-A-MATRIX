# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : Import numpy as np
### Step 2: We have created a matrix using array and we will find inverse of this.
### Step 3: We can find the inverse of the martix by using np.linalg.inv and passing the matrix.
### Step 4: Finally, print the value of the inverse of the matrix.



## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:K SAGAR KRISHNA
#RegisterNumber:22006940
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]])
result=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(result)
```
## Output:
